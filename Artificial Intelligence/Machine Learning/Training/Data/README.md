# Training Data

Training applications handle three categories of data

<br>

| Training Application Data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input Data (*Training Data*) | A collection of individual records containing the features important to your machine learning problem that's used during training to configure your model to accurately make inferences about new instances of similar data (The values in your input data never directly become part of your model) |
| Parameters | Variables that your chosen machine learning technique uses to adjust your data (They are what distinguished your particular model from other models of the same type working on similar data) |
| Hyperparameters | Configurable variables that govern the training process itself (Not directly related to the training data and remain constant during a training job) |
