# Machine Learning Overview

[ML](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-machine-learning?hl=en) is a subset of AI that enables machines to autonomously learn and improve using neural networks and deep learning without being explicitly programmed and by feeding it large amounts of data

* Allows computer systems to continuously adjust and enhance themselves as they accrue more experiences (The performance can be improved by providing larger and more varied datasets to be processed)

<br>

The success of ML, DL, and LLMs is more due to 
* Availability of data (Big data)
* Availability of more powerful computational engines (*GPUs*, *TPUs*, *NPUs*, *etc.*)
* Quantum computing

<br>

`Inputs * Weights + Bias = Prediction`
