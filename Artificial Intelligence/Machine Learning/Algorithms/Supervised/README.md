# Supervised Learning Overview

* Supervised learning is an ML paradigm for problems where the available data consists of labeled examples meaning that each data point contains features (covariates) and an associated label

# Supervised Learning Components

## Labels 

* The label is what you're trying to predict

<br>

## Features

* Features are the input parameter (input data) to the model to use to predict the label
* Contains labels as well since the data is labeled and based on this feature data we create a model that we'll use to predict the future

## Model

* Predicts the relationship between the features and your label
