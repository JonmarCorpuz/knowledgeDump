# Weights Overview

A [weight](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/weight-artificial-neural-network) is a numerical value associated with the connections between neurons across different layers of the network

* Each connection from one neuron to another has associated weight that signifies the strengh and direction of the influence one neuron has on another
* Directly influence the signals transmitted across the network and ultimately determining the network's output
