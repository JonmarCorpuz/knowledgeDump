# Machine Learning Workflows Overview

A [machine learning workflow](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/machine-learning-workflow.html) is the systematic process of developing, training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models

* Ensures that ML projects follow best practices, maintain consistenct, and increase the likelihood of building effective and reiiable models
* Helps define project goals, roles, and responsibilities more clearly
* Provides a systematic approach to tackling complex machine learning projects leading to improved efficiency and productivity
* Helps systematically execute each stage of the machine learning process leading to help identify and address potential issues early on in the project lifecycle
* Helps improve risk management by identifying potential risks and uncertainties early in the project lifecycle

# Maching Learning Workflow Steps 

## 1. Problem Definition

Clearly identifying the problem to be solved and establish the project goals (*Understanding the business context*, *Identifying relevant data sources*, *Defining key performance metrics*, *etc.*) 

1. Understanding the business objectives (Identifying the key business challenges or opportunities to address)
2. Formulate a problem statement (Devising a clear and concise problem statement)
3. Define success criteria (Establishing measurable KPIs)
4. Identify data requirements and constraints (Identifying the data requirements)
5. Risk assessment (Identifying potential risks and challenges associated with the problem definition)
6. Document the problem definition (Documenting the problem statement, success criteria, data requirements, scope, constraints, and risk assessment findings)

## 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Gathering the necessary data from various sources and preprocess it to ensure it's clean, consistent, and ready for analysis (*Data cleaning*, *Feature engineering*, *Data transformation*, *etc.*)

1. Define objectives (Clearly defining the objectives)
2. Identify data sources (Determining where to find the data needed)
3. Assess data quality (Assessing the data's accuracy, compleness, consistency, relevance, and timeliness)
4. Document data sources and processing steps (Maintaining comprehensive documentation of the data sources, collection methods, preprocessing steps, and any transformations applied to the data)
5. Iterate (Continuously evaluating the relevance and quality of the data to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the machine learning model)

<br>

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns, trends, and relationships (*Helps understannd the characteristics of the data and informing decisions about feature selection, model selection, and data preprocessing strategies*) 

1. Handling missing data (Identifying columns or features with missing values in the data set)
2. Handling outliers 
3. Data normalization (Standardization, min-max scaling, and robust scaling)

<br>

## 4. Model Selection and Training 

Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms and techniques based on the problem requirements and data characteristics, train the selected models using the prepared data, and evaluate their performance using suitable evaluation metrics 

1. Understanding the problem (Determining whether the problem is a classification, regression, clustering, or other type of task)
2. Selecting candidate models (Leveraging domain expertise to identify models that are commonly used and suitable for similar tasks in the domain)
3. Evaluating model complexity and interpretability (Considering the complexity of the model and its capacity)
4. COnsidering performance metrics (Considering metrics for classification tasks)
5. Comparing and validating models (Starting with simple baseline models to establish a performance benchmark, training them using appropriate training and validation data sets, evaluating )
6. Selecting the best model (Considering trade-offs between mode complexity, interpretability, computational resources, and performance metrics, and then evaluating the best-performing model using test data)
7. Iterating and refining (Iterating by refining feature engineering, hyperparameters, or trying different algorithms until satisfactory results are achieved)

<br>

## 5. MOdel Evaluation and Tuning 

Assessing the performance of the trained models using validation techniques (*Cross-validation*, *Hyperparameter tuning*, *etc.*) 

1. Data splitting (Dividing the data set into training and validation sets)
2. Choosing the algorithm (Selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithm to train the model based on your problem type)
3. Instantiating the model (Creating an instance of the chosen model by initializing its parameters)
4. Training the model (Fitting the model to the training data using the .fit() method)
5. Optimizing model parameters (Performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance)
6. Model evaluation (Evaluating the trained model's performance using the validation set and calculating relevant metrics)
7. Final model selection (Retraining the final model using the entire training data set to maximize learning before deployment once satisfied with the model's performance on the validation set)

<br>

## 6. Model Deployment and Monitoring 

Deploying the trained model into the production environment, integrate it into the existing systems, monitor the model's performance in real-world scenarios, and update it as needed to ensure continued effectiveness 

1. Model serialization (Serializing the trained model into a formal suitable for deployment)
2. Integration with the production environment (Choosing an appropriate deployment environment and integrating the model into production using frameworks or libraries specific to the chosen environment)
3. Scalabiity considerations (Designing the deployment architecture to handle various loads and scalability requirements while taking various factors into consideration)
4. Real-time predictions (Ensuring the model supports real-time predictions if required)
5. Monitoring and performance metrics (Implementing monitoring solutions to track the model's performance in productioon)
6. Versioning and model updates (Establishing a versioning strategy for the deployed models to track changes and facilitate rollback if necessary)
7. Security and compliance (Implementing security measures to protext the deployed model, data, and endpoints from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches)
8. Documentation and collaboration (Maintaining detailed documentation for the deployed model)
