# Unsupervised Machine Learning Overview

* Uses raw input data containing unlabeled data sets that you'll create groups based on similar patterns (You can then use these patterns for customer segmentation for example)
* There's no features and labels, everything is just raw data and the algorithm will just try to identify the different blocks using different techniques
