# Deep Learning Algorithms Overview

* Typically trained on large datasets of labeled data
* Builds ML models based on sample data in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so

<br>

# 2-Step Process

This is done once
```Text
Inpu Data --> Training <--> Validate --> Test --> Model
```

* Compare the training data set with the validation data set
* Test with unseen data to see if the output is expected

<br>

This is done multiple times
```Text
Model --> Serving Infrastructure --> Prediction
Input -->
```
