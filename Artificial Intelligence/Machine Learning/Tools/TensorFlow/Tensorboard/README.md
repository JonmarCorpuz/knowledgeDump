# Tensorboard Overview

[Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard) is a tool for providing the measurements and visualizations needed during the machine learning workflow (To improve something you often need to be able to measure it)

* Provides the visualization and tooling needed for ML experimentation (*Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy*, *Visualizing the model graph*, *Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors that change over time*, *Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space*, *Displaying images, text, and audio data*, *etc.*)
