# Embedding Overview

[Embedding](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/embedding) is a means of representing objects as points in a continuous vector space where the locations of those points in space are semantically meaningful to ML algorithms

* An embedding is a vector representation of words and they encode in such a way you can figure out similarity between the entities
* Use cases include recommendation, NLP, sentiment analysis, etc.
* Can be used to represent users and items in a common space (This allows the recommender system to learn the relationships between users and items)
* Helps machine learning to identify similarity between objects or things or even in languages
* Can be computationally expensive (Can sometimes be difficult to interpret by human and can be sensitive)
