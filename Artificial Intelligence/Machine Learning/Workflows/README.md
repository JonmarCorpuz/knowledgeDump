# Machine Learning Workflows Overview

A [machine learning workflow](https://www.purestorage.com/knowledge/machine-learning-workflow.html) is the systematic process of developing, training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models

* Ensures that ML projects follow best practices, maintain consistenct, and increase the likelihood of building effective and reiiable models

# Maching Learning Workflow Steps 

## 1. Problem Definition

Clearly identifying the problem to be solved and establish the project goals (*Understanding the business context*, *Identifying relevant data sources*, *Defining key performance metrics*, *etc.*) 

1. Understanding the business objectives
2. Formulate a problem statement
3. Define success criteria
4. Identify data requirements and constraints
5. Risk assessment
6. Document the problem definition

<br>

## 2. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Gathering the necessary data from various sources and preprocess it to ensure it's clean, consistent, and ready for analysis (*Data cleaning*, *Feature engineering*, *Data transformation*, *etc.*)

1. Define objectives
2. Identify data sources
3. Assess data quality
4. Document data sources and processing steps
5. Iterate

<br>

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns, trends, and relationships (*Helps understannd the characteristics of the data and informing decisions about feature selection, model selection, and data preprocessing strategies*) 

1. Handling missing data
2. Handling outliers
3. Data normalization

<br>

## 4. Model Selection and Training 

Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms and techniques based on the problem requirements and data characteristics, train the selected models using the prepared data, and evaluate their performance using suitable evaluation metrics 

1. Understanding the problem
2. Selecting candidate models
3. Evaluating model complexity and interpretability
4. COnsidering performance metrics
5. Comparing and validating models
6. Selecting the best model
7. Iterating and refining

<br>

## 5. MOdel Evaluation and Tuning 

Assessing the performance of the trained models using validation techniques (*Cross-validation*, *Hyperparameter tuning*, *etc.*) 

1. Data splitting
2. Choosing the algorithm
3. Instantiating the model
4. Training the model
5. Optimizing model parameters
6. Model evaluation
7. Final model selection

<br>

## 6. Model Deployment and Monitoring 

Deploying the trained model into the production environment, integrate it into the existing systems, monitor the model's performance in real-world scenarios, and update it as needed to ensure continued effectiveness 

1. Model serialization
2. Integration with the production environment
3. Scalabiity considerations
4. Real-time predictions
5. Monitoring and performance metrics
6. Versioning and model updates
7. Security and compliance
8. Documentation and collaboration
