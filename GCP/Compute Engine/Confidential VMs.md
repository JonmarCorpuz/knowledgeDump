# Confidential VM Overview

A confidential VM instance is a specialized type of GCE VM instance that uses hardware-based memory encryption to protect data and applications during processing, at rest, and in transit

* Provides an additional layer of security against potential threats by encrypting sensitive code and data in memory
* Operates within a Trusted Execution Environment
* Encryption keys are generated by the hardware's secure processor and never leave the chip (Ensures that no external party can access the encryption keys)
* The VM's memory is isolated from other VMs and the hypervisor (Reduces the attack surface for memory scraping or other exploits)

# Trusted Execution Environment

* Provides isolation and integrity guarantees for workloads

# Attestation Report

An attestation report is a piece of cryptographic evidence generated by a confidential computing environment that proves the VM is running inside a trusted and hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environment

* Contains measurements and information about the VM's software, hardware, and firmware state (*Bootloader activity*, *Hardware configuration*, *Firmware configuration*, *etc.*)
* Can only be verified on the same platform (Remote verification can be enabled by converting the report into a quote by a Quote Enclave which will sign the report with a certified attestation key)

## TDX Token

TDX tokens are cryptographically signed attestation token generated as part of the IntelÂ® Trust Domain Extensions confidential computing environment on Google Cloud

* The TDX module inside the CPU will generate an attestation report to prove the VM is running in a secure, hardware-isolated environment (The attestation report is then converted into a standards-based Entity Attestation Token which contains claims about the VM's environment, configuration, and trustworthiness)
* Allows external services or applications to verify that the VM is running in a genuine TDX-protected environment along with the expected security properties and software stack

## ITA Verifier Client

The Intel Trust Authority is the client-side component that requests, receives, and verifies attestation evidence from a Confidential VM 

* Checks this evidence often via an attestation service to ensure that the VM's environment meets security requirements before allowing sensitive actions (*Releasing encryption keys*, *Releasing secrets*, *etc.*)
