# AutoML Training Phases Overview

## Phase 1: Auto Data Preprocessing

AutoML will provide functions to automate part of the data preparation process (ex: *Convert certain data types into a certain data format so that it can be fed into an ML model*)

## Phase 2: Architecture Search and Tuning

AutoML will search for the best models and tune the parameters

| Phase 2 Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Neural Architecture Search** | A technique that involves trying different architectures and models and then comparing their performance against each other in order to find the best performing one (*AutoML will search through multiple advanced ML models and automatically tune the parameters to find the best fit for your data*) |
| **Transfer Learning** | A training technique that lets people with smaller data sets or less computational power achieve greater results by using pre-trained models that were trained on similar larger datasets and then feeding it with their smaller data sets |
