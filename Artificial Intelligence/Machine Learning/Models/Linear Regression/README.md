# Response vs Predictor Variables

There is an asymmetry in many of prediction problems:
> The variable we would like to predict may be more difficult to measure, is more important than other(s), or may directly or indirectly be influenced by the other variable(s)

Thus, we'd like to define two categories of variables:
* Variables whose values we want to predict
* Variables whose values we use to make our prediction

# True vss Statistical Model

>We will assume that the response variable (Y) relates to the predictors (X) through some unknown function, f(X), that expresses an underlying rule for relating Y to X and a random amount Epsilon (unrelated to X) that describes the difference Y from the rule f(X)

The equation will become `Y = f(X) + Epsilon`

# Prediction vs Estimation

>When we use a set of measurements (x I1 to x ip) to predict a value for the response variable, we denote the predicted value by:

`Y hat i = f hat given the x I1 to x IP`

The hat denotes an estimate
