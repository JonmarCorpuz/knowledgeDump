# Feature Engineering Overview

Feature engineering is a the process of transforming raw data into features that improve the performance of machine learning models by selecting, creating, manipulating, and transforming data attributes to make them suitable and informative for model training

* A feature is an individual measurable property, characteristic, or attribute of the data being used to train a model (*Also commonly called variables or input variables*)
* Can significantly influence model performance by providing more accurate, relevant, and understandable information for learning
* Properly engineered features typically lead to simpler models with better accuracy and reduced processing time
* Good feature engineering makes models more interpretable and helps them generalize better to new and unseen data
