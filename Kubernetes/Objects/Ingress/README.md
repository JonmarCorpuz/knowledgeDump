# Kubernetes Ingress Overview

[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster by exposing HTTP or HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster

* Defines rules to control traffic routing (These rules are implemented with an [Ingress Controller](https://github.com/JonmarCorpuz/knowledgeDump/blob/main/Kubernetes/Objects/Ingress/Ingress%20Controller.md))
* Provides other possible features and configuration options for Services (*externally-reachable URLs*, *Load balance traffic*, *Terminate SSL/TLS*, *etc.*)
