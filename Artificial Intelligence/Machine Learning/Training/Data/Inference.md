# Inference Overview

Inference is the process where a trained model uses new and unseen data to make predictions, classifications, or decisions (The stage after training where the model applies what it has learned to real-world or live data to generate actionable outputs)

* Uses the model's learned patterns and parameters from the training phase to interpret and predict outcomes on fresh input data
* Operationalizes a model (*Identifying objects in images*, *Predicting stock prices*, *Detecting fraud in transactions*, *etc.*)
