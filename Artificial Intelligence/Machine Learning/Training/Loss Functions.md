# Loss Function Overview



<br>

# Regression

* Mean squarred error
* Underfitting or overfitting
* RMSE = 0 (Zero)

<br>

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error Metric (RMSLE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* MAPE, Log loss

<br>

## Overfitting

<br>

# Classification

## Overfitting

<br>

# Accuracy 

* Gives you a sense of how well your algorithm is doing

<br>

Accuracy = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions

<br>

Accuracy = TP + TN / TP + TN + FP + FN

<br>

## Precision

Accuracy = Number of correct predictions / Total number of predictions

<br>

Precision = True positive - Truly positive / True positive + False positive

<br>

## Recall

Recall = True positive - Truly positive / True positive + False negative

<br>

# Positive Rate

<br>

## True Positive Rate

TPR = TP / TP + FP

<br>

## False Positive Rate

FPR = FP / FP + TN

<br>

# F1 Measure

F1 score = Harmonic Mean of precision and Recall

<br>

# Iterative Approach

# Learning Rate

<br>

# Gradient Descent

* Multiplies the gradient by a scalar known as the learning rate to determine the next point
