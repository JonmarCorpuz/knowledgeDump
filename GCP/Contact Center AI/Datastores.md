# Datastore Best Practices

* Aim to remove irrelevant content from the knowledge base in order to keep the document concise and relevant as a best practice (Common irrelevant content: *Navigation bar*, *Last-modified dates*, *Feedback forms*, *etc.*)
* Exclude documents with potentially non-supported content (ex: *audio*, *video*, *images*, *etc.*)
* Break large documents down into multiple short documents in order to help make it easier for agents to find answers in the suggested documents
* Only keep updated and useful documents
