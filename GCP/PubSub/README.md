# Pub/Sub Overview

[Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview) is an asynchronous and scalable messaging service where the senders of messages are decoupled from the receivers of messages

* Allows services to communicate asynchronously (With latencies of 100 milliseconds)
* Used for streaming analytics and data integration pipelines to load and distribute data (Equally effective as a messaging-oriented middleware for service integration or as a queue to parallelize tasks)
