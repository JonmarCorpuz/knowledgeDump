# Loss Function Overview

A loss function is a mathematical function used to measure how well a machine learning model's predictions align with the actual target values in a dataset

* Quantifies the difference or error between the predicted output of the model and the true values by providing a numeric representation of the model's performance
* Aims to help minimize the difference betweenthe predicted output and the current output

Objective functions (The objective can be very different depending of the function being used)
* mean squared error (L2 loss)
* absolute error (L1 loss)
* cross entropy loss

* What objective would give me the best possible line
* How important is it to start from a good standing point?
* Add a penalty term to the objective function (I want to make sure I'm not too far from where I'm starting so adding a penalty would help bring you back if you start moving away from it)
