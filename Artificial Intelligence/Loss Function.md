# Objective/Cost/Loss Function Overview

<br>

Objective functions (The objective can be very different depending of the function being used)
* mean squared error (L2 loss)
* absolute error (L1 loss)
* cross entropy loss

<br>

* What objective would give me the best possible line
* How important is it to start from a good standing point?
* Add a penalty term to the objective function (I want to make sure I'm not too far from where I'm starting so adding a penalty would help bring you back if you start moving away from it)
