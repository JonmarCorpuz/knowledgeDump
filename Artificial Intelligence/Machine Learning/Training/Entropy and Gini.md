# tmp

* We calculate Entropy / Gini for features and choose the one with the less Entropy or Gini

<br>

# Entropy

* Entropy is the measure of impurity or uncertainty in the data

<br>

# Gini

* Gini index calculates impurity of system with just different mathematic formula

# Pure and Impure Data
