# Activation Function Overview

An activation function is a mathematical function applied to a neuron's input to determine whether that neuron should be activated or not by applying certain mathematical operations (*Similar to how neurons in the human brian decides to fire based on stimuli*)

* Main purpose is to introduce non-linearity into the model in order to allow NNs to learn and represent complex patterns in data (Without activation functions, NNs would behave like simple linear models no matter how many layers they have which limits their ability to solve complex tasks)
* Transforms the weighted sum of inputs into an output that's passed to the next layer or as the final output
