# Pooling Overview

Pooling is a technique used to downsample or reduce the spacial dimensions (width and height) of input feature maps while retaining most information by operating on small regions of the feature map and applying a fixed operation to it in order to summarize that region's features (The result is a reduced-size output that preserves key features)

* Makes models faster, more efficient, and less sensitive to small changes or noise in input data by simplifying it
